# london_schools_aq.py
Analyzing air pollution data around London schools using Python. The goal here is to determine the extent of air pollution that students in London experience and whether levels of exposure vary across different types of schools or localities.

The "london_schools_aq.py" file analyzes air quality (specifically nitrogen dioxide, NO2) levels at schools in the London area. This dataset contains a list of 3261 schools with 12 columns. The source is the UK government open data website (https://data.gov.uk). This specific dataset can be accessed here: https://data.gov.uk/dataset/90b02236-3a4e-4899-8bdc-7f5122df4d9e/schools-and-educational-institutions-air-quality-exposure-data-broken-down-by-parliamentary-constituency

The following describes the files in this repository:

1. The "basic_data_analysis.py" file contains Python code for basic viewing of the dataset.
2. The "london_schools_aq.py" file is a module that allows the user to select a specific city or school type and get the average NO2 level for that particular selection.
